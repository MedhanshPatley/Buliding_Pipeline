# Building Pipeline

Inside the `building_pipeline.py`, you will find the `pipeline` function. Within this function, all necessary functions are imported from the `DA_Assignment.ipynb` file. 

Additionally, the `DA_Assignment.ipynb` file also contains a `pipeline` function. This allows you to utilize the same functionality inside the notebook, making it easier to work with and test.

By importing the functions into the Python file, I aimed to make the functions more accessible and easier to use, while keeping all the necessary logic within the notebook.

## Files

- `building_pipeline.py`: This file contains the main pipeline function, which integrates all functions imported from the `DA_Assignment.ipynb` file.
- `DA_Assignment.ipynb`: This notebook contains the definitions of all functions used within the pipeline.
